# PokeBOX
Pokemon Team Analyzer

PokeBOX is a probject that allows users to log in, add Pokemon to their virtual box, and select teams of their own Pokemon to be
analyzed for type matchups, allowing them to edit their team to perform with peak coverage.

# What's In the Box?
PokeBOX is written using PHP and uses MySQL databases to store the Pokemon and their corresponding game data.
Game data is fetched from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/), a free resource that contains all the data on Pokemon species, moves, and types.

By integrating the MySQL databases, users can insert and retrieve relevant data that allows for a simple user interface
to let them create teams and note their weaknesses.

The project is hosted on AlterVista, a free web hosting site, since it allows me to use PHP and MySQL scripts necessary for this
project's completion.
